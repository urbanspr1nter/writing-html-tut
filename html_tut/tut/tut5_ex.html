<h2>Introduction</h2>
A <b>volcano</b> is a location where magma, 
or hot melted rock from within a planet, reaches the surface. 
It may happen violently, in a massive supersonic explosion, 
or more quietly, as a sticky, slow lava flow.
<p>
Volcanoes have been a part of earth's history long before
humans. Compare the history of human beings, a few million
years in the making, to that of the Earth, over four
<b><i>billion</i></b> years in the making.
<h2>Volcano Terminology</h2>
