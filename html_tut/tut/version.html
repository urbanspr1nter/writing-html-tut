<H1>Version History</H1>

<dl>

<dt><b>before the next version</b>
<dd>While translating WritingHTML into French, <strong>Bernard Bensoussan</strong>, shared a lengthly list of typos and important corrections. Merci Bernard for this and providing a complete French version <a href="http://realgar.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut_fr/">French "Ecrire le HTML"</a> ! <strong>Jane Wilson</strong>, and <strong>J.L. Merrill</strong> (writing HTML at age 73!) also notified us of several typos.
<br><br>

The sharp eyes of <strong>Lennart Holmquist</strong> and 
<strong>Greg Trevellick</strong> identified several more pesky typos. Also, after many repeated requests, we have compiled the content of all lessons into a single, nicely printable, PDF document (though it comsumes 330 pages, so be kind to the trees). See the bottom of the <a href="download.html#pdf">download page</a>.
<br><br>
<dt><b>version 4.5.2 / June 2000</b>
<dd><strong>Patty Erion</strong> who lives near Mount St Helens and was there when it erupted in 1980, suggested that a more accurate description would be that "the pine trees were toppled over like <b>toothpicks</b>, not toys." This has no affect on any HTML, but we do like to be accurate!
<br><br>
Gerry Pareja from Vancouver BC confirmed that the tutorial files could indeed be downloaded and run under Windows 3.1, so we updated the <a href="download.html">archives</a> for those remaining users of this relict system. John Du Brain unearthed numerous pesky typos (thanks JD!)
<br><br>
We also added the template from <a href="http://translator.go.com/">go.com</a> for translating the lesson pages into 5 different languages. For the lessons on <a href="tut28b.html">Video</a> and <a href="tut29c.html">Audio</a>, we added directions for how to use alternative media formats (MPEG, AVI for video and WAVE for audio) for those who cannot use QuickTime.  Also, in a fit of artistic ennui, we updated the <a href="pictures/tut.gif">logo</a>.
<br><br>
<dt><b>version 4.5.1 / January 2000</b>
<dd>Modified all uses of JavaScript window openers to use the <b><tt><font color="#000066">onClick()  return false</font></tt></b> option rather than linking to a "dummy" anchor, hypertext links to work for non-JavaScript enabled browsers. See lesson <a href="tut27a.html">27a</a> for details.<br><br>
<dt><b>version 4.5 / November 1999</b>
<dd>New lessons for multimedia (<a href="tut29.html">29</a>) including GIF animations (<a href="tut29a.html">29a</a>), digital video (<a href="tut29b.html">29b</a>), <a href="tut29c.html">audio</a>, <a href="tut29d.html">shockwave</a>, and <a href="tut29e.html">Java</a>. Wrote extra tips in <a href="tut21.html">lesson 21</a> for using tables to center text or title on any size browser window and made them part of the splash page introduced in lesson <a href="tut24.html">24</a>. Also, we spiffed up the <a href="pictures/tut.gif">Writing HTML logo</a> and cleaned up the main Volcano Web (<a href="pictures/lava.gif">lava.gif</a>) file to make it cleaner and smaller in file size.
<br><br>
Luke Burnham and others were kind enough to spot some typos and sloppy grammar in the later lessons. All lessons were cleaned up to approach transitional HTML 4.0 standards.
<br><br>
Kazuaki Mizota has translated Writing HTML into <a href="http://www.bea.hi-ho.ne.jp/mizota/tut/">Japanese (v 4.0.1)</a>.

<br><br>
<dt><b>version 4.0.1 / May 1999</b>
<dd>Updated for inclusion with <a href="http://www.thinkquest.org/">Thinkquest</a> 2000 CD-ROM. Typos corrected thanks to many writers, especially the careful eye of <strong>Guy Vaughn</strong>. More resources add to <a href="ref/index.html">reference section</a>, which has been subdivided into separate sections accessible via a JavaScript driven menu. Tested for compatibility with Internet Explorer 5.0
<br><br>
<dt><b>version 4.0 / December 1998</b>
<dd>Long overdue! Created new format for demonstrating example web pages. Updates to reflect references to HTML 4.0, condensing of text on <a href="index.html">main entry page</a>, added notes for tags covered on <a href="lessons.html">lessons page</a>, use of JavaScript menus in the <a href="tags/index.html">tags reference</a>, clarified explanation of file structure references with more diagrams in lessons <a href="tut8a.html">8a</a> and <a href="tut14.html">14</a>. Added section in <a href="tut21.html">lesson 21</a> for using images as backgrounds in table cells. Revised more modern look for <a href="http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/alumni.php">alumni form</a> and <a href="http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/ten_alumni.php">random alumni</a> page results. Top page links added to view the <a href="http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/kudos.php">email feedback "kudos"</a>. Re-designed all lesson download pages to better depict the file structures used in the examples.
<br><br>
New lessons on  META tags (<a href="tut24.html">24</a>), targeting windows (<a href="tut25.html">25</a>), frames (<a href="tut26.html">26</a>), introductory JavaScript (<a href="tut27.html">27</a>), JavaScript alerts and MouseOver (<a href="tut27a.html">27a</a>), JavaScript Dynamic Content (<a href="tut27b.html">27b</a>), JavaScript Custom Window Openers (<a href="tut27c.html">27c</a>), JavaScript Image Swapping (<a href="tut27d.html">27d</a>), Forms (<a href="tut28.html">28</a>), designing forms <a href="tut28a.html">(28a)</a>, making forms work with email and CGI (<a href="tut28b.html">28b</a>) as well as JavaScript (<a href="tut28c.html">28c</a>).
<br><br>
Because of some problems in maintaining connections, we provided two additional <a href="download.html">download</a> sources for the tutorial files. 
And as always, with the help from our users such as <strong>Pat Shauer</strong>, we made corrections to typos.
<br><br>
<dt><b>version 3.0.4 in Korean / November 1998</b>
<dd>Dr. Byeong Choon Lim, Department of Computer Education
Chuncheon National University of Education has been translating Writing HTML into <a href="http://learning.cnue-e.ac.kr/html/Tutorials/index.html">Korean</a>
<br><br>

<dt><b>version 3.0.4 / August 1998</b>
<dd>Minor fixes of URLs that have changed, some typos corrected. Added more options for the <b><tt><font color="#000066">mailto:</font></tt></b> tag in <a href="tut12.html">lesson 12</a>. A number of corrections were made in the <a href="http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut_es/">Spanish version</a> of the lessons thanks to Andr&eacute;s Valencia.
<br><br>

<dt><b>version 3.0.3 / December 1997</b>
<dd>Lots of people on Windows were having trouble with the .zip versions of the tutorial so the <a href="download.html">download page</a> now sends them out as self-extracting archives. 
<br><br>
<dt><b>version 3.0.2 in Icelandic / July 1997</b>
<dd>Thanks to <strong>Gudjon Olafsson</strong>, we now have a version in Icelandic / &Iacute;slenska called <a href="http://www.fvi.is/tut/">Forritun &iacute; HTML</a>
<br><br>
<dt><b>version 3.0.2 / July 1997</b>
<dd>Hopefully some of the last typos are squashed, with a great deal of help by Maureen Nelson, a professional proofreader, who printed out the entire tutorial and provided some great red pen "mark-up" for the typos. Thanks also to Joel Smallbeck and Leah Simpson for suggestions on wording. Also Douglas Nady provided a useful pointer about resizing images from smaller to bigger that is now part of <a href="tut7a.html">lesson 7a</a> and demonstrated as <a href="tut7a_ex/test1.html">Going from Small to Big</a>. Some of the example URLs for geology/volcano sites have been updated. Also, a general <a href="ref/index.html">reference</a> page has been added with links to it from the top of all lesson pages. And no one to date noticed the discrepancies for the sample files for lessons 8e - 12, until spotted by Erin Cormier! Now you can <a href="download.html">download</a> a tutorial archive for Windows95 (the only difference is that it has file names that end in ".html". Oh how revolutionary...). We also compiled the frequent email feedback into a section called <a href="http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/kudos.php">What People Say Abut Writing HTML</a>.
<br><br>
<dt><b>version 3.0 in Spanish! / February 1997</b>
<dd><strong>Arturo Garcia Martin</strong> kindly translated the entire tutorial into <a href="http://realgar.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut_es/">Spanish</a>.
<br><br>
<dt><b>version 3.0.1 / January 1997</b>
<dd>Fixed typos in lessons 8d (thanks to <strong>Gene Menzies</strong>) and the lesson 18 test page (thanks to <strong>Benjie Wolicki</strong>), and even on this page (thanks to <strong>Leo Robert Klein</strong>). Benjie also correctly pointed out that it is not safe to say that Olympus Mons is the largest volcano in the <b>universe</b>, but rather "the largest known volcano in the solar system"
<br><br>
<dt><b>version 3.0 / October 1996</b>
<dd>Revised and corrected typos (from lots of net feedback) in all lessons. Tables added throughout lessons as any browser worth using now supports tables. Simplified instructions for downloading image files. All sample HTML in lessons is now <font color=#000066>color coded.</font> Added comment tags to <a href="tut1.html">lesson 1</a>, more examples for using <b><tt><font color="#000066">&lt;br&gt;</font></tt></b> tags for headers in <a href="tut4.html">lesson 4</a>, non-breaking space in <a href="tut10.html">lesson 10</a>, color name codes for <a href="tut16.html">lesson 16</a>, font FACE options in <a href="tut18.html">lesson 18</a>, colored table cells in <a href="tut21.html">lesson 21</a>. Broke up the big <a href="tags/index.html">tag summary</a> table into separate pages.
<br><br>
Finally gave up on ever trying to write more advanced lessons as the web just changes and grows too damn fast. The whole thing is getting complicated by the glut of new features introduced by Netscape vs Microsoft.
<br><br>

<dt><b>Version 2.0 / December 1995</b> <font face="verdana,helvetica" size=2">(<a href="http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/server/old/tut2-0/tut2-0.html">snapshot of v2.0</a>)</font>
<dd>Cleaned up typos. Added explanation for <b><tt><font color="#000066">height</font></tt></b> and <b><tt><font color="#000066">width</font></tt></b> attributes for inline images in <a href="tut7a.html">lesson 7a</a>. Re-organized lesson structure for pictures in subfolders and example
files for lessons after <a href="tut8a.html">lesson 8a</a>. This not only explained other ways of linking web directories, but made it more managable for setting up the example files for later lessons where one page became many pages. Added explanation in lesson <a href="tut8a.html">lesson 8a</a> for relative URLS that link upwards in the directory structure. New lessons on <a href="tut14.html">Splitting vs Lumping</a> (14) of long web pages; <a href="tut15.html">Netscape and HTML 3.0 issues</a> (15); <a href="tut16.html">colored and texture backgrounds</a> (16); the dreaded <a href="tut17.html">&lt;blink&gt;</a> tag (17); <a href="tut18.html">spiffing up text</a> (colors, sizes, superscripts, subscripts) (18); more <a href="tut19.html">options for the <b><tt><font color="#000066">&lt;hr&gt;</font></tt></b> tag</a> (19); <a href="tut20.html">aligning text and images</a> (20); <a href="tut21.html">Tables</a> (21); <a href="tut22.html">More for Images and Lists</a> (22); and <a href="tut23.html">Clickable Image Maps</a> (23)
<a href="http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/ten_alumni.php">Alumni page</a> now pulls 10 names at random rather than listing them all.
<br><br>
<dt><b>Version 1.7 / November 1995</b>
<dd>Still fixing typos with the help of our audience. Added <a href="tag.html">summary page</a> for all HTML used in the tutorial and
a <a href="faq.html">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</a> page.
With help from <a href="http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/~kurt/">Kurt Leinbach</a>, developed <a href="http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/alumni.php">CGI form</a> for 
registering our <a href="http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/ten_alumni.php">alumni</a> 
<br><br>
<dt><b>Version 1.51 / September 1995</b>
<dd>New lesson for <a href="tut13.html">Blockquotes</a> (13).
<br><br>
<dt><b>Version 1.5 / August 1995</b>
<dd>Re-writes for improved directions and fixed the many typos (thanks to
Jennifer Adamson). Minor cosmetic changes. Added <b><tt><font color="#000066">&lt;br&gt;</font></tt></b> tag to <a href="tut2.html">lesson 2</a>.
Until we write some new lessons, provide links to sites for HTML 3.0, CGI,
Image Maps.
<br><br>
<dt><b>Version 1.41 / June 1995</b>
<dd>Removed use of the underline <b><tt><font color="#000066">&lt;u&gt;</font></tt></b> tags which were once supported
by NCSA Mosaic. Added <a href="tut12.html">lesson 12</a> for using the <b><tt><font color="#000066">mailto:</font></tt></b> link
and the <b><tt><font color="#000066">&lt;address&gt;</font></tt></b> tag.
<br><br>
<dt><b>Version 1.4 / May 1995</b>
<dd>Removed directions specific to NCSA Mosaic, new logo. Several
links to external sites were updated.
<br><br>
<dt><b>Version 1.3.1 / February 7, 1995</b>
<dd>Typos fixed as well as inconsistencies in the sample lessons, with
thanks to <strong>Robin Wright</strong>.
<br><br>
<dt><b>Version 1.3 / December 15, 1994</b>
<dd>New lessons added for <a href="tut8d.html">Named Anchors</a> (8d); 
<a href="tut9.html">Preformatted Text</a> (9);
<a href="tut10.html">Special Character Sets</a> (10); and 
<a href="tut11.html">Descriptive Lists</a> (11). 
Information on using the <b><tt><font color="#000066">ALT</font></tt></b> keyword in the 
<b><tt><font color="#000066">&lt;IMG&gt;</font></tt></b> tag was added to <a href="tut7a.html">lesson 7a</a>, "Inline Graphics".
<br><br>
<dt><b>Version 1.2 / November 15, 1994</b> <font face="verdana,helvetica" size=2">(<a href="http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/server/old/tut1-2/tut1-2.html">snapshot of v1.2</a>)</font>
<dd>Links to external sites were verified and updated. Directions
were re-written to take into account the increasing number of different web
browsers, each of which may have commands under different menus.
Navigation links between lessons were moved to the top of the page.
<br><br>
<dt><b>Version 1.1 / July 1, 1994</b>
<dd>Based on the surveys from our June workshop, we updated several the exercises 
to make the descriptions more clear. First version placed
on our <a href="http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/">WWW server</a>. 
Although the files are the same for different platforms,
we made separate <a href="download.html">download-able</a> archives for Macintosh and DOS formats 
(difference in how DOS and Mac systems differ in the use of carriage returns
in the text files) 
<br><br>
<dt><b>Version 1.0 / June 1, 1994</b>
<dd>This was the first version of the tutorial, as written for a 2 day workshop
for faculty at 
<a href="http://www.smc.maricopa.edu/">South Mountain Community College</a>, 
and included lessons 1-8.
