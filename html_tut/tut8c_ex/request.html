Calvin,</p>
<p>
Thank you for providing this excellent service. This message is to let you know that we have a few links to your site that are part of a free tutorial we have created designed to help people learn how to create web pages:</p>
<p>

<p>
In this tutorial, the exerices lead to building a web site about Volcanoes, with a section about "Volcanoes on Mars"</p>
<p>
None of your images or content is used in our materials, we just use your site as an example of linking to an external site, and linking to an image on an external site. Having read your copyright statement, I think we are in compliance. The example page that we have students create is at</p>

<p>
If there are any problems with our links to your site, please let us know. Thanks in advance.</p>
