In this lesson you will use the Internet to research
information on volcanoes and then write a report on your
results.

A volcano is a location where magma, 
or hot melted rock from within a planet, reaches the surface. 
It may happen violently, in a massive supersonic explosion, 
or more quietly, as a sticky, slow lava flow.
