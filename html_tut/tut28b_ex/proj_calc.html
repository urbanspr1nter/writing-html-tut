<h3>Equation Kinetic and Potential Energies</h3>
To better understand the many kinds of volcanoes, we can use some
math and the laws of physics. In an eruption, you can track a
"block" of volcanic material from some point where all of its
energy is potential energy and equate it at some other point
where it is at a maximum of kinetic energy:

<p>
where <font color="red"><b>m</b></font> is the mass of the
"block", <font color="red"><b>g</b></font>  is the gravity
acceleration constant, <font color="red"><b>h</b></font>  is the
height where all energy is potential energy, and <font
color="red"><b>v</b></font> is the velocity when the kinetic
energy is at a maximum.
<p>
Assuming conservation of energy, with some algebra we can write 
this relationship as:

<font size=+3><tt> 2 g h = v<sup>2</sup></tt></font>

<p>
This means that if we know a height at which a volcanic flow
surmounted an obstacle, we can estimate its maximum velocity at
some point before or after the obstacle. This technique was used
to estimate the maximum flow velocity of a landslide in Iran that
climbed a 600 meter hill as well as a volcanic eruption in Japan
that climbed 500 meters over a mountain pass. The estimates are
supported by observations of these events.

<h3>Equation Kinetic and Potential Energies</h3>
Use the form below to calculate estimated maximum velocities for
volcanic eruptions where you can document how far they have
climbed (for large <a href="term.html" target="_top">Plinian</a>
eruptions, some researchers use the maximum height of the
eruption cloud).

Note that this is a very generalized way to look at volcanic
eruptions; i.e. it does not account for losses of energy due to
friction nor the different mechanics for fluid flow. However, it
has proven to be useful to compare different volcanoes.
