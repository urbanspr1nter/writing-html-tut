<h1>Volcano Web</h1>
In this lesson you will use the Internet
to research information on volcanoes and then write a report on your
results.

<H2>Introduction</H2>
A <b>volcano</b> is a location where magma, 
or hot melted rock from within a planet, reaches the surface. 
It may happen violently, in a massive supersonic explosion, 
or more quietly, as a sticky, slow lava flow.
<p>
Volcanoes have been a part of earth's history long before
humans. Compare the history of human beings, a few million
years in the making, to that of the Earth, over four
<b><i>billion</i></b> years in the making.

<h2>Volcano Terminology</h2>
The study of volcanoes, or <tt>Volcanology</tt>, includes many
odd terms. How many of these do you know?
<ul>
<li>caldera
<li>vesicularity
<li>pahoehoe
<li>rheology
<li>lahar
</ul>
<h2>Volcanic Places in the USA</h2>
Listed below are two places in the United States that are
considered "active" volcanic areas.
<h3>Mount St Helens</h3>
On May 18, 1980, after a long period of rest, this quiet
mountain in Washington provided <a href="msh.html">detailed
observations</a> on the mechanics of highly explosive
eruptions.
<h3>Long Valley</h3>
<h2>Volcanic Places on Mars</h2>
<h2>Research Project</h2>
Your mission is to find information and report on a volcano,
other than the ones listed above, that has erupted in the
last 100 years. Your reports must include:
<ol>
<li>Type of volcano
<li>Geographic location
<li>Name, distance, and population of nearest major city
<li>Dates of most recent and most destructive eruptions.
<li>Other events associated with recent eruptions (earthquakes, floods, mudslides, etc)
</ol>
<p>
Then, write a one page description on the major hazards to
humans in the vicinity of this volcano. Speculate on what
you would do if you were in charge of minimizing the risk
to the population.
